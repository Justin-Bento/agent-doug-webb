              About, Douglas J. Webb!
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-4">
              <p>
                Doug got involved in residential investment real estate in 1986
                which ultimately led to a full time career in real estate sales
                in 1997 with RE/Max. To provide his clients with the latitude of
                service which he and most of his clients sought, Doug moved to
                Right At Home Realty.
              </p>
              <p>
                The business generated through the referral of his satisfied
                clients along with their letters and thank-you cards is
                something he is very proud of.
              </p>
